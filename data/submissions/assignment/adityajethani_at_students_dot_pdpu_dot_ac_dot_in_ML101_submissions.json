    "Feedback": {
      "Strengths": "The student demonstrates a good understanding of the Locally Weighted Regression algorithm and its key components. They correctly implement the kernel function and the prediction function, and they recognize the importance of the bandwidth parameter (tau). The student also provides a clear interpretation of the bias-variance tradeoff in the context of LWR.",
      "Areas for Improvement": "The student's submission lacks visual evidence of their implementation. While they describe the plotting process, no actual plots are included. Additionally, the student doesn't explore a wide range of query points and bandwidths, limiting the depth of their analysis."
    },
    "Detailed Analysis": "The student accurately defines the objective of the assignment and correctly implements the LWR algorithm using a Gaussian kernel. Their code for `kernel` and `predict` functions is clear and logically sound. However, the absence of any plots prevents a full assessment of their understanding of how LWR works in practice.  The student's interpretation of the bias-variance tradeoff is accurate, but they could strengthen their analysis by showcasing the effects of different tau values on the fitted curves. A broader exploration of query points would also provide a more comprehensive understanding of LWR's capabilities."
